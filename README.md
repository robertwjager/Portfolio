## About Me

My name is Robert, a coding enthusiast on a quest to become a Java Web Developer. When I'm not immersed in coding, you can find me exploring the chilling worlds of Resident Evil and Silent Hill, embarking on epic adventures in Final Fantasy, or embracing the challenge of Dark Souls. ðŸŽ®

I'm not just a developer; I also love to make different genres of music. I produce metal, rock, trap, soundtrack and electronic music. ðŸŽ¹

In between coding and music, I love to travel, eat unhealthy amounts of sushi and pizza, and I am a big fan of horror movies. Huge fan of anything related to the genre really! ðŸ’€

On this page, I proudly present my coding creations and remarkable projects that define my journey as a developer. ðŸ¤“
